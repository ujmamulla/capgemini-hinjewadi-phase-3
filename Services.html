                <p>What we do:</p>

                    <p>1.Continuous business reinvention:</p>
                    <p>There comes a point when a new entrant into the market or shifting consumer tastes will threaten your core business. 
                    And, at that moment, no amount of investing in the customer experience of your existing business is going to save you. You need to do something different – you need to challenge the status quo. That is the promise and the premise behind Continuous Business Reinvention. Imagine. Make. Scale. Be Bold.</p>
                    
                    <p>2.Customer experience:</p>
                    <p>Your customer experience must transform the relationship you have with your customers, and build trust that provides sustainable value, both for them – and for you. We embrace emotions, sensitivity, and intuition to invent new experiences. Grounded in rigorous analysis and cutting-edge technologies, these are as personal as they are effective. They build relationships, one interaction at a time. You. At scale.</p>

                <p>1.Our portfolio of cybersecurity services:</p>
                    <p>your enterprise doesn’t have to be overwhelming. Accelerate transformation with Capgemini as your trusted partner.</p>
                    <p>2.Insurance:</p>
                       <p>Drive growth with automated, accurate risk assessments and cyber insights.</p>
                    <p>3.Smart factories are increasingly being utilized by industry as part of the transition toward digitization. Being connected to cloud or the internet, they bring a plethora of 
                         communicative advantages. 
                         However, this network connection also creates a larger surface area vulnerable to attack via digital means.As a result, smart factories are being widely targeted by cyberattacks. 
                        <p>4.In our newest Capgemini Research Institute report, Smart & Secure:</p>
                             Why smart factories need to prioritize cybersecurity, we explored the issue in detail and surveyed 950 organizations 
                             to gauge their level of cybersecurity preparedness as it relates to smart factories.Smart factories are undoubtedly the way forward for manufacturing, but their increased exposure to 
                             cyberattacks comes with multiple risks.</p>

                <a href="#">DATA AND AI</a>
                <p>1.Data for augmentation:</p>
                    <p>Generative AI dominates much of this section, yet there's a vast expanse beyond GenAI. Consider the frontier of next-generation semiconductors or envisioning the potential of an autonomous enterprise.</p>
                <p>2.Data for humans:</p>
                    <p>The intersection of technology and sustainability holds a pivotal role. From spearheading the fight against climate change to propelling breakthroughs in healthcare, we persistently push the boundaries of what was once considered unattainable.</p>
                <P>3.Generative AI (gen AI) represents the next evolution of AI systems – characterized by its ability to learn, adapt, and collaborate in ways once reserved for human intelligence:</P>
                    In its Harnessing the value of generative AI report, the Capgemini Research Institute noted that 96 percent of the executives surveyed have put the technology on their boardroom agenda. That said, many leaders are unsure how to get started. 
                    Generative AI has emerged as a game-changing technology that promises to reshape all industries and redefine the way people interact with organizations. The potential benefits are staggering, but businesses must understand that harnessing gen AI’s full potential is contingent upon careful preparation.
                    
                    In this Q&A with Capgemini’s Ollie East, Head of Go-to-Market Strategy and US GenAI CX Lead; Shawn Goodin, Principal MarTech Strategist, Customer Data & AI; and Pranav Kumar, Digital, Data, and AI Business Leader, discuss on why CX teams need a seat at the gen AI table.</P>

                <p>1.Hyper-convergence​:</p>
                    <p>Hardware and software are being brought closer together, traditional industries are blurring their boundaries (e.g., automotive and energy) and future innovations will fuse together the digital, physical, and biological.</p>
                <p>2.Hyper-connectivity​:</p>
                    <p>Connected products are creating ecosystems around the customer (e.g. smart homes), but on a grander scale, 5G is creating private networks for use in smart cities and even battlefield applications.</p>
                <p>3.Hyper-intelligence​:</p>
                    <P>AI and quantum computing are creating autonomous systems that can be trained at an accelerated rate (for example, autonomous driving or new drug development).</p>
                <p>4.OPmobility expands software innovation for mobility:</p>
                    <p>Working with Capgemini, the automotive manufacturer grew its Op’n Soft program, adding onto the team’s capabilities in order to improve its ability to drive innovation in areas such as assisted driving, infotainment, and sustainability</p>
